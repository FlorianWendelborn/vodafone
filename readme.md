# Vodafone

> Keeps shitty ISPs accountable by collecting data automatically

Pings 3 servers once a second and does a `speedtest.net` speed-test every 10 minutes.

Keeps the results in `logs/ISO-TIME.ndjson` (newline-delimited JSON)

## Naming

My ISP "Vodafone" decided that my Gigabit connection running at 8 Mbit/s down and 0.2 Mbit/s up and 3000ms ping is acceptable. They’re working very hard and will fix it until March 2022. (state January 2021).

It’s supposed to be 1000 Mbit/s down, 50 Mbit/s up and (since they claim it’s fibre optics) 5ms ping.

They offered me a 40% reduction in monthly fees for it, **if and only if** I call them once a month to beg for it. This is highly disrespectful of my time and it’s very clear that they only do it because they hope I don’t call them.
